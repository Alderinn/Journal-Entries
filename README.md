This project was created to just get my first taste maintaining a project, using VScode, and learning git, understanding branches, venv, etc. 
All this program can do currenltiy is:
- Create/View Today's Journal entries
- Search entry by date/modify existing
- List all entries

Entries are stored in .yml files (I'm sure there's a better way to store them -sql or something)

If you come across this and want to help out, submit a pr or comment somewhere. I'm always looking for ways to learn and improve!
